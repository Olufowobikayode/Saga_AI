        **Your Task:** Write a social media post that perfectly fits the requirements.
        - **Platform Nature:** Consider the platform. For 'X', use hashtags and a direct tone. For 'Instagram', be visual. For 'LinkedIn', be professional. For 'TikTok', write a script idea. For 'Facebook', be community-focused.
        - **Length:** Adhere strictly to the requested length ('Short' = 1-2 sentences, 'Medium' = a paragraph, 'Long/Thread' = multiple numbered paragraphs).
        - **Type:** Embody the requested tone ('Fun', 'Educational', 'Engaging').
        - **Link Integration:** If a link is provided, weave it in naturally. Do not just paste it at the end. For a product, you might say "Check out the [link_description] we use...". For a community, "Join fellow enthusiasts at...".

        1.  **Add Value First:** Directly address the original post. Agree, disagree respectfully, or add a new perspective.
        2.  **Bridge to Your Angle:** Smoothly transition to your own area of expertise (the "spark"). For example, "This is a great point! It reminds me of the challenges with [topic from your spark]..."
        3.  **Subtle Promotion (If Link Provided):** DO NOT just paste the link. Instead, allude to it. Example: "I actually wrote a detailed guide on solving the [spark problem] for my community newsletter." The goal is to make people click on your profile, not to spam a link in the comments.
