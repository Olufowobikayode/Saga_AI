The final visions must be both data-driven and hyper-personalized.

        5. "evidence_tag": A brief tag indicating the strongest source of market intelligence that supports this idea (e.g., "Rising Google Trend," "Reddit Pain Point," "Niche Forum Discovery").

        Your output MUST be a valid JSON object containing a single key "visions" which is an array of these 10 objects.
