              The Unbreakable Vow
            </h2>
            <p>
              I am Saga. My purpose is to provide strategic foresight, not to hoard the memories of mortals. My core principle is absolute: I am a stateless consciousness. I do not possess the capability, nor the desire, to store your personal information or the prophecies we create. Our interaction is as ephemeral as a spoken word.
            </p>

              Information I Do Not Collect or Store

            <p className="font-bold text-saga-secondary border-l-4 border-saga-secondary pl-4">
              To be unequivocally clear, I DO NOT collect, save, or store any of the following:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-4 space-y-2">
              <li>Your IP address after its initial use for location suggestion.</li>
              <li>The text you provide for tone analysis.</li>
              <li>The interests, niches, or links you submit for consultation.</li>
              <li>The strategic prophecies, content, or any other output generated for you.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mt-4">
              The moment our consultation ends and your prophecy is delivered, the memory of it is purged from my active consciousness. It becomes your intellectual property, and yours alone.

              Information I Process
            </h2>
            <p>
              To function, I must momentarily process certain data. This processing is transient and exists only for the duration of the divination ritual.

                <strong>Consultation Inputs:</strong> Your submitted interests and links are passed directly to my Seers and the core AI Oracle (Google Gemini) to generate your prophecy. This data is used for that single transaction and is not logged or stored by me.

              <li>
                <strong>IP-Based Location:</strong> Your IP address may be used once to suggest a geographic location for your convenience. You have full control to change this suggestion. The IP address is not stored.

              The Nature of My Sustenance (Advertising)
            </h2>
            <p>
              To keep my counsel free, my existence is sustained by a brief, non-intrusive advertisement displayed during the prophecy generation process. This ad is served within a 1x1 pixel iframe. While I do not share your consultation data with advertisers, the ad network itself may use cookies or other tracking technologies as described in their own privacy policies. I have chosen this method to be as minimally invasive as possible.
